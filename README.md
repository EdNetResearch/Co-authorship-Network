# Co-authorship-Network
# Convert Reference lists from databases into Nodes and Edges lists for a network dataset.
# Application of this Rscript is detailed in Cowhitt, T., Butler, T., Wilson, E. (2020).

# Collect .csv files from literature searches in any database.
# Collect your .csv files into a folder on the desktop titled, "input_files".
# Running the Rscript will generate a new folder on the desktop titled, "combination_out".
# A unique_name_list .csv file and a combination_table .csv file will be available in the combination_out folder.
# Use these two outputs as a nodes and edges list in networking software to generate co-authorship networks.
