# Co-authorship-Network
Convert reference lists exported from databases into nodes and edges lists based on reference authors.  This will allow you to create a co-authorship network using network analysis software.
Application of this Rscript in literature reviews methods is detailed in Cowhitt, T., Butler, T., Wilson, E. (2020). Using Social Network Analysis to Complete Literature Reviews: a new systematic approach for independent researchers to detect and interpret prominent research programs within large collections of relevant literature.

Export .csv files from literature searches in any database.
Collect all .csv files into a folder on the desktop titled, "input_files".
Running the Rscript will generate a new folder on the desktop titled, "combination_out".
A unique_name_list .csv file and a combination_table .csv file will be available in the combination_out folder.
Use these two outputs as a nodes and edges list in networking software to generate co-authorship networks.
